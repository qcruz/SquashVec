# Card Effects Reference
*Complete list of implemented effect types for use in card design.*
*All effects are configured via the card's `options` array in cards.js.*

---

## Event Effects (used in `options[n].effect`)

### Stacking

**`stack_on_category`**
Stack this card's value on a specific category's event stack.
- `targetCategory: string` — category to stack on
- `condition?: object` — if provided, card discards itself when condition is not met

**`stack_on_any_modal`**
Player chooses which category to stack this card's value on, constrained to a specific set of choices.
- `bonusValue: number` — value to add (overrides card's own value)
- `choices: string[]` — **required** — 2 category names the player may choose between. Design rule: all cards must specify choices; open "any category" is not permitted for balance.

**`pay_own_stack_then_stack_on_any`**
Take the oldest resource from own category stack, then stack this card's value on a player-chosen category.
- `ownCategory: string` — category to take resource from
- `choices: string[]` — **required** — 2 category names the player may choose between. Design rule: all cards must specify choices; open "any category" is not permitted.
- *(stack value comes from the card's `value` field)*

**`stack_on_category_then_discard_hand`**
Stack this card on a specific category, then player discards 1 card from hand.
- `targetCategory: string`
- *Used by: Immigration Opt 2 — stack on Culture, then discard 1 hand card*

**Design rule — stack destination choices:**
All stacking cards that redirect to another category must declare exactly 2 choices from the following pairings. The player picks one:

| Own Category | Choices |
|---|---|
| Economy | Governance, Military |
| Culture | Governance, Environment |
| Military | Economy, Governance |
| Technology | Economy, Environment |
| Environment | Culture, Technology |
| Governance | Economy, Military |

### Instability Removal

**`remove_instability_modal`**
Player chooses a category; takes oldest N instability cards from that pile → deck.
- `maxRemove?: number` — how many to remove (default 1)
- `targetCategory?: string` — restrict to a single category pile
- `selfDiscardFlow?: boolean` — if true, uses card's `discardTo` after resolution
- `afterShuffle?: boolean` — if true, shuffles this card into the deck after resolution (overrides selfDiscardFlow)

**`remove_lowest_instability_modal`**
Player chooses a category; takes the **lowest-value** instability card from that pile → deck.
- `selfDiscardFlow?: boolean`

**`remove_two_instability_modal`**
Player picks 2 different categories; takes the oldest instability from each → deck. Card goes to discard.

**`move_instability_modal`**
Player picks a source category then a destination; oldest instability card is moved between piles.
- `selfDiscardFlow?: boolean`

---

### Resource Movement (Move Without Removal)

**`move_newest_resource_to_sparse_stack`**

Two-step modal: player picks any source stack (≥ 1), then any target stack (different from source). The newest resource moves source → target. Card shuffles to deck.
- *Used by: Consolidation Opt 1*

**`move_newest_instability_any`**
Two-step modal: player picks any source instability pile (≥ 1), then any target pile (different). The newest (top) instability card moves source → target. Card shuffles to deck.
- *Used by: Consolidation Opt 2*

**`move_newest_resource_then_move_newest_instability`**

---

### Multi-Stack Removal (Management Philosophy)

**`remove_two_newest_resources_remove_instability`**
Three-step chain: player picks 2 stacks; removes newest resource from each → deck. Then picks 1 instability pile; removes oldest card → deck. Card to deck.
- *Used by: Managed Decline Opt 1*

**`remove_all_oldest_then_remove_two_instability`**
Immediate + modal chain: auto-removes oldest resource from every non-empty stack → deck. Then player picks 2 instability cards to remove → deck. Card to deck.
- *Used by: Managed Decline Opt 2*

**`strip_stack_to_oldest_and_instab`**
Two-step: player picks a stack with 2+ resources. Removes all resources except the oldest → deck. Also removes all instabilities from that category's pile except one (keeps oldest) → deck. Card to deck.

- *Used by: Austerity Opt 1*

**`remove_three_resources_clear_one_pile`**
Chain: player picks 3 stacks (newest resource from each → deck). Then player picks one instability pile — all instabilities cleared → deck. Card to deck.
- *Used by: Austerity Opt 2*

Remove all resources from a specified stack → deck. Place this card in the specified instability pile.
- `targetStack: string` — category whose stack is cleared
- `targetInstability: string` — instability destination
- *Used by: Environmental Collapse Opt 2*

**`remove_stack_card_then_remove_crime_instability`**
Take the oldest resource from `sourceCategory` stack → deck. Remove all Crime-arc instability cards (crime, criminal_conspiracy, organized_crime) from all category piles → deck. Place this card in Governance instability.

- *Used by: Martial Law Opt 1*

**`remove_multi_stack_then_remove_crime_instability`**
Take the oldest resource from each listed stack → deck (list may repeat a category to require multiple). Remove all Crime-arc instability from all piles → deck. Place this card in Governance instability.

- *Requires: Military stack ≥ 1 card*

---

### Hand / Draw

**`discard_from_hand_then_shuffle_self`**
Player picks N cards from hand to discard. Then shuffles this card into the deck (ignores `discardTo`).
- `count?: number` (default 1)

**`draw_and_shuffle_self`**
Draw 1 card. Shuffle this card into the deck.

**`draw_and_discard_self`**
Draw 1 card. Discard this card using `discardTo`.

**`draw_if_hand_small`**
Draw 2 cards. Uses card's `discardTo` for self-disposal.
- `condition?: object` — if provided, only draws if condition is met; otherwise card discards itself

**`discard_from_hand_modal`**
Player picks N cards from hand to discard. Then uses card's `discardTo`.
- `count?: number` (default 1)
- `condition?: object`

**`discard_hand_then_self`**
Player discards 1 card from hand. Then uses card's `discardTo` (or places self in instability).
- `afterInstability?: string` — if set, places self in that category's instability after hand discard

---

### Hazard / Utility

**`place_self_to_instability`**
Place this card directly into a category's instability pile.
- `targetInstability: string` — e.g. `'governance'`, `'economy'`

**`suppress_hazard`**
Instead of full mitigation, place a marker in `altInstability` with value `altValue`. Card is discarded.
- `altInstability: string`
- `altValue: number`

**`take_resource_to_economy`**
Take a resource card from one of `sourceCategories` and move it to the Economy stack.
- `sourceCategories: string[]`
- `afterEffect?: string` — `'remove_military_discard_self'` requires Military stack ≥ 1

**`global_event_escape`**
Individual escape option for global event cards. First checks the card's cooperative threshold (handled automatically at the top of `resolveEventCard` — if met the card is negated before this runs). If not negated, pays the escape cost; if payment fails, applies the penalty instead.
- `escapeCost: string[]` — list of 3 category names to remove oldest resource from (e.g. `['economy', 'governance', 'technology']`)
- Card-level properties used: `cooperativeThreshold`, `thresholdCategory`, `penaltyCategory`, `penaltyCount`, `penaltyType`
- *Always eligible (`canPlayOption` returns true)*

**`global_event_penalty`**
Penalty option for global event cards. Cooperative threshold is checked automatically before this runs (see note above). If not negated, applies the penalty directly.
- Card-level properties used: `penaltyType`, `penaltyCategory`, `penaltyCount`
- `penaltyType: 'remove_stack'` (default) — removes N oldest resources from `penaltyCategory` stack → deck
- `penaltyType: 'deck_to_instability'` — takes N cards from draw deck top → `penaltyCategory` instability pile
- *Always eligible (`canPlayOption` returns true)*

> **Global event card properties** (set on the card object, not the option):
> - `cooperativeThreshold: number` — deck count of `thresholdCategory`-tagged cards needed to auto-negate
> - `thresholdCategory: string` — tag name to count in the draw deck
> - `penaltyCategory: string` — category affected by the penalty
> - `penaltyCount: number` — number of cards/resources affected
> - `penaltyType: 'remove_stack' | 'deck_to_instability'`
> - `mustPlayWhenDrawn: true` — required on all global event cards

**`discard_self`**
Simply discard this card using `discardTo`. No additional effect.

**`multiplayer_only`**
Not available in solo play. Card is discarded.

**`replace`**
Identity card effect — replaces the current active card in `targetCategory`. Takes `costCategory` and `costAmount` for the resource payment.
- `targetCategory: string`
- `costCategory: string`
- `costAmount: number`

---

## `discardTo` Target Values
*(Used on card definition's `discardTo` array — applies when card leaves play)*

| Target | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `shuffle_to_deck` | Card shuffles into the draw deck |
| `[category]_instability` | Card goes to that category's instability pile |

> **Note:** There is no `discard_pile` target. All cards cycle — they go to instability or back to the deck. This is a core design constraint.

### `discardTo` Bonus Values
- `bonus: 'draw_1'` — draw 1 card after the card is placed

---

## Condition Object (used in `option.condition`)

```js
condition: {
  type: 'hand_size_lte',  // hand size ≤ value
  value: 3,
}
// or
condition: {
  type: 'category_score_gte',
  category: 'governance',
  value: 14,
}
// or
condition: {
  type: 'instabilityExists',  // any instability pile has ≥ 1 card
}
// or
condition: {
  type: 'card_in_instability',  // a specific card ID is in any instability pile
  cardId: 'criminal_conspiracy',
}
// or
condition: {
  card_in_stack: { id: 'alliance' }
  // returns true if any category's event stack contains a card with that id
  // optional: add category: 'governance' to restrict to one stack
}
```

---

## Autoplay Stats — Data Model

Each autoplay mode (`random`, `generalist`, `maximizer`) has its own stat block in `AUTO.stats[mode]`:

```js
{
  games: 0,           // total games completed
  wins: 0,
  losses: 0,
  turnHistory: [],    // G.turn at end of each game
  scoreSpread: [],    // max(categoryScores) − min(categoryScores) at game end
  cardPlays: {},      // { cardId: playCount }
  optionPlays: {},    // { 'cardId:optionIndex': playCount }
  tagPlays: {},       // { tagName: playCount } — incremented per tag on every card played
  winCats: {},        // { categoryId: winCount } — category that triggered the win
  loseCats: {},       // { categoryId: lossCount }
}
```

**Tag play tracking:** Every time a card is played via `autoSelectAndPlay`, all tags on the card increment their counter in `ms.tagPlays`. This accumulates across the entire run and is displayed in the stats panel as "Tag plays" (top 15 by count).

**Stats display:** The detail panel shows a single column for the currently active mode. Switching modes immediately reflects that mode's accumulated data. Header bar stats (games/wins/losses/win rate/avg turns) also reflect the active mode only.
