# Governance — Finalized Deck Builds

> This document tracks the best-performing deck builds found through testing.
> The **Current Build** is what is loaded in STARTER_DECK in `js/cards.js`.
> When a new build replaces the current one, the old build moves to **Build History** — never deleted.
> Use build history to revert to an earlier composition at any time.

---

## How to Use This Document

- **Current Build** — the active STARTER_DECK composition. Update this section whenever STARTER_DECK changes.
- **Build History** — archived builds in reverse chronological order. Each has a full card list so the deck can be fully reconstructed.
- **Updating:** When changing the deck, copy the Current Build block into Build History (with date and reason for replacement), then overwrite Current Build with the new composition.

---

## Current Build — Build 1 (2026-07-15)

**Deck size:** 276 slots · 167 unique card IDs
**Composition:** 80 hazards (29%) · 108 stacking/territory (39%) · 44 utility/philosophy (16%) · 38 identity (14%) · 6 other (2%)
**Hazard:utility ratio:** 1.8×
**Status:** First finalized build. Deck rebalanced from 308-slot bloated build (4.6× hazard:utility ratio). Doubled management philosophy cards. Removed duplicated hazard sections.

### Scoring Formula
```
Category Score = 10 (base) + active identity value + sum(stack values) − sum(instability values)
Win: any category reaches 20 · Lose: any category drops to 0
```
